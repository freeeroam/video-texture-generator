# Video Texture Generator

Third year project - Video texture synthesis# Video Texture Generator

A tool which synthesizes infinitely-playing "video textures" from a given input video. The tool analyses the frames of the video and uses a variant of reinforcement learning to select and then schedule a number of low-cost transitions in order to minimise the amount of noticeable visual discontinuities.

## Requirements
- G++ or any modern C++ compiler compatible with C++11.
- OpenCV 2.4
